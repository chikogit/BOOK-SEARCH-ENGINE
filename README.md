### Accessing the Search Engine

Upon visiting our website, you will encounter a menu with two primary options: "Search for Books" and "Login/Signup." Additionally, there is an input field for conducting book searches and a submit button for quick access.

### Login/Signup

Selecting "Login/Signup" opens a modal window with two distinct choices: "Log In" or "Sign Up." New users opting for "Sign Up" are prompted to create a unique username, provide an email address, and set a secure password before clicking the "signup" button. Returning users can choose "Log In" and enter their registered email address and password to gain access.

### Searching for Books

Once logged in, the menu transforms to offer three primary options: "Search for Books," "See My Saved Books," and "Logout." You can perform book searches, with each result displaying comprehensive book details and an option to save the book to your account.

### Account Management

Clicking "See My Saved Books" presents you with a list of books you've saved to your account, each featuring book details, descriptions, author information, images, and links to the respective book on Google Books. You can also remove books from your list with ease.

### Logging Out

To log out, simply select "Logout." This action reverts the menu to its initial options, allowing you to enjoy effortless book searches, efficient account management, and a well-organized collection of your favorite reads.
